#### List of data
1. eDNA
2. Plankton imagery (planktoscope)
3. Seascapes
4. PACE data
5. Cruise data (aph, ag, Chla, nutrients, CTD profiles)
6. Water quality
7. Above water Rrs


#### What is the story?
1. Spectral PACE data analysis w/SA algorithms
2. Phytoplankton community product
3. What is the spectral signature of blooms? Of seascapes?
4. Bio-optics to help validate PACE data
5. What ecological processes can we track w/PACE data?
6. Taxonomic data (eDNA)
7. WHich groups are driving the ocean color signal?


#### Action items
1. Diatom blooms from CPICS - plankton concentration
2. PACE imagery (spectral analysis)
3. eDNA?
4. Should we look at a specific cruise? - July 2024 (cloudy), May 2024 (best)
 - May 2024 images downloaded (WS24139 - 5/18-5/25)
 - Obtain and process (1D composite, grid) PACE files (need to updata periodically)
 - Extract, plot and analyze spectra - how to summarize in 1 number for a regression?
5. Good images:
 - 20240511T174724 (good)
 - 20240512T181718 (ok)
 - 20240512T182218 (good, north of 1st 5/12 image)
 - 

5. Process and analyze the ASD data (access on Google drive)

## Items remaining
- [X] Seascapes figure?
- [X] Spectra from MODA, VSNPP, OLCI
- [] Text for figures
- [] Background on SVH, PCC
- [] Non-anonymized doc
- [] Project management section (anon)
- [] DMP
- [] Methods (need EMH and Luke's text)
- [] Refs. (last)
- [] Doc to PDF (last)




#### Sections in the proposal
1. Full spectral characterization of seascapes w/above water Rrs (spectral function for each class) - is phytoplankton driving seascapes?
2. 2nd derivative analysis of above water Rrs at a particular station, compare to ss (want a spectral function for each ss)
3. Table of datasets
4. Map(s)
5. Case study from one cruise (May 2024? WS2024139 - No CPICS)
6. 

#### Meeting with MTK on 10/22/24
1. Question of scale? - Global w/SS, but need more in-situ data
2. PACE in terms of SS continuity, but not for this call (need science, not products)
3. Hyperspectral signature as a function of water type
4. Look at Jianwei Wei work from UMBC (K-means clustering of reflectance)
5. MTK will also have a proposal in this call. Want complementarity. Similar approach in different regions.
6. SS products using PACE - not for this call, but relative phyto community composition dominance OR seasonal variability of SS and PACE fluorescence products
7. Budget for MTK here? - Depends on the questions.
