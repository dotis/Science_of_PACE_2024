### NASA ROSES SCIENCE OF PACE PROPOSAL

Personnel:
1. PI Otis (3-4 months)
2. Co-I FMK (1 month)
3. Co-I EMH (1 month)
4. Luke Thompson
5. Postdoc (USF)
6. Joaquin?

#### List of data
1. eDNA
2. Plankton imagery (planktoscope)
3. Seascapes
4. PACE data
5. Cruise data
6. Water quality
7. Above water Rrs


#### What is the story?
1. Spectral PACE data analysis w/SA algorithms
2. Phytoplankton community product
3. What is the spectral signature of blooms
4. Bio-optics to help validate PACE data
5. What ecological processes can we track w/PACE data?
6. Taxonomic data (eDNA)
7. WHich groups are driving the ocean color signal?


#### Action items
1. Diatom blooms from CPICS - plankton concentration
2. PACE imagery (spectral analysis)
3. eDNA?
4. Should we look at a specific cruise? - July 2024 (cloudy), May 2024 (best)
5. Process and analyze the ASD data (access on Google drive)

#### Sections in the proposal
1. Full spectral characterization of seascapes w/above water Rrs (spectral function for each class) - is phytoplankton driving seascapes?
2. 2nd derivative analysis of above water Rrs at a particular station, compare to ss (want a spectral function for each ss)
3. Table of datasets
4. Map(s)
5. Case study from one cruise (May 2024? WS2024139 - No CPICS)
6.
